title: "Generating Benchmark Data Sets for Subspace Outlier Detection"
layout: post
---

Novel approaches for outlier detection in high dimensional data sets are typically benchmarked with real world and synthetic data sets. This blog post describes a simple approach to generate high dimensional data sets in which outliers are placed into correlated subspaces. Each of the outliers is placed into the subspace 

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
